                <div id="servicesBackEndParsDiv">

                    <p id="servicesBackEndMainPar">In the web development field there are two main camps. There is the "Front End", or as it's commonly referred to in the field as the "Client Side". It reflects most of what you may visually see on any given website; the layout, the images, the content and the way it's styled and interacts with user input. And then there's the "Back End", or as it's commonly referred to in the field as the "Server Side". If you think about the personal information a user may need to store and retrieve later (EX: as in a social media type profile with its information) than you are dealing with the back end. The way any web browser works is that when you type in a web address the browser sends a signal to the hosting service where all the website files are located on a server and retrieves and displays them on the browser window. If a user will type in any information without the back end being set up to save this information and than exits out of that page, than all of that information will be lost. The browser does not remember that kind of information unless the website is set up to save it back on a server and to comminicate with the front end.</p>

                    <p id="servicesBackEndSecondaryPar">The back end is not necessarily my specialty. But I have enough knowledge to implement most simple ideas that rely on the server side like contact forms, log in systems, user profiles, etc. I encourage you to contact me with your specific questions and ideas that you may need related to the back end and I will answer them as best as I can.</p>
