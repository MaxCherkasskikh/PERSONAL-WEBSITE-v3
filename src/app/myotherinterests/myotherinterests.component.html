        <div id="musicDiv" class="music">

          <p id="musicPar">Music is my first love and passion. I was born into a musical family. I have been involved with music (actively) since 7th grade. I moved out to Los Angeles to purse music as my main career as a DJ/Producer/Songwriter. I got my associates degree in Sound Engineering from Shoreline Community College in Shoreline, WA (15 minutes north of Seattle, WA). I love all types of music having played in a large variety of bands. I started with playing drums, picked up piano (which is what led me into music production) and came around to acoustic/electric guitar and bass guitar a little bit down the road. My biggest influences are Kaskade, Zedd, Above & Beyond, Seven Lions, Myon, Jason Ross, Andrew Bayer and a slew of other top DJ/Producers in the EDM scene.</p>

        <div id="softwareDiv" class="music">

          <p id="softwarePar">I feel as though I have always had a love for all things "internet" related. A lot of us that are born in the late 80's and earlier have come to rely heavily on technology. Despite the fact that music has always been "MY THING" I have come to be fascinated with the numerous crevices of web/app/software development. There is so much opportunity and directions one can go. As many of us are, I was fortunate to be born into the advent of the Digital Age. In my teen years I have witnessed the likes of Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Elon Musk bringing amazing technology to the world. I draw inspiration from all these people. I am constantly learning some new coding language that will be useful to me down the road with personal projects. The plan has always been to be a "Full Stack" developer with software and app development abilities. I have a ton of personal plans (down the road) to develop my own technology that'll be "The Next Thing". I strongly belive in my abilities and drive. It's only a matter of time.</p>

        <div id="videoDiv" class="music">

          <p id="videoPar">I have also come to love the video and animation industry. The way all types of videos (long and short format) are made fasciates me as I draw a ton of parallels between the way they are made in comparison to music. It's a similar creative and technical process. I also love animation. I have grown up with cartoons just like most people my age and have gotten to witness the rise and growth of digital animation. Part of what fascinates me about it is the ability to combine music and video/animation as a cohesive experience in concert. As a music artist I want to bring an "unforgettable" experience to the audience. I believe that my mission in life is to "entertain people and make their life easier with technology".</p>

        <div id="gamingDiv" class="music">

          <p id="gamingPar">I also grew up along with the gaming industry. I can remember playing those Tony Hawk skater games on a PS1 in my early teen years. They always brough joy and entertainment to me and my friends and family. Down the road I have come to play and love a number of different gaming franchises like Metal Gear, Tomb Raider, Assassin's Creed and the like. The gaming industry is ripe for opportunity. Games like FORTNITE are a clear example of the fact that there is a ton of room for extra entertainment in peoples lives. I hope to one day run my own media entertainemtn conglomerate that puts out amazing games.</p>

        <div id="bartendingDiv" class="music">

          <p id="bartendingPar">In between a multitude of jobs I've held in my life I have picked up bartending. I love bartending because it combines people and alcohol, the cause and solution to all of our problems :) !!! Just kidding... But, growing up in a conservative home we never really drank. I grew up in a fairly sheltered community. But when I got older, developed my own opinions about things in life and started going out in my early 20's I developed a love for all types of alcohol. I find the history behind the various liquors fascinating and the science behind mixology fun. I believe that drinking in moderation is always the way to go. It should add to your day, not subtract from it. I hope that one day I am able to own a whole brand of liquor.</p>
