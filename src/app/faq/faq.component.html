        <p id="question1" class="faqQuestions">Q: What does a website consist of?</p>

          <p id="answer1" class="faqAnswers">A: A typical website (at its simplest) consists of three primary files and their types; the HTML file (Content structure file), the CSS file (Content styling file) and the JAVASCRIPT file (Content interactivity file). Depending on the number of pages on the website there may be multiple HTML, CSS or JAVASCRIPT files that correspond to each page. Every page needs at least one of each. Now, that's an oversiplified answer. In reality there may be a number of other files attached to it (aside from the primary three) depending on the complexity of the website. Some developers decide to also use some jQUERY (which is a framework on top of JAVASCRIPT) for all the extra animation and interactivity needs of the website. Some choose to go further and use other frameworks like Angular, React or Vue for websites that are more complex, that are taxing on the browser and therefore need to load faster due to the sheer amount of interactivity. But even without using a framework a number of other files may be attached to the website. Most websites have a way to contact the business. A server-side language like PHP is used for all the contact forms and things like profiles. If a website requires user information to either be sent or retrieved later than a PHP file is needed to handle the information requests from the server. Sometimes a more complex website requires user profiles (think social media type profiles) and will therfore have a MySQL databased stored on the server. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System where all of the user information will be stored and than retrieved from down the road. So there is no definitive answer. It largely depends on the complexity, size and the needs of the website. A website can have anywhere from 3-6 files or 20-30 files. Huge websites like Facebook, Twitter or Instgram may have even more.</p>

        <p id="question2" class="faqQuestions">Q: How does a website work?</p>

          <p id="answer2" class="faqAnswers">A: When you type in an address in any browser it makes a request to the server asking to retrieve any and all files that are saved on the server (at the hosting service) of that website. It retrieves the files and than reads and displays them on your browser in tendam and within milliseconds. It reads the HTML file and displays all of the content that this file has; things like text, images, etc. It reads the CSS file and tells the browser to style every content element the way the developer predefined them to be styled. It also reads the JAVASCRIPT file and tells certain elements to bahave a certain way and to do things that are timed to perform certain animations or to react to user input (think pressing buttons). If a user comes to a contact form and types in all the information and presses "Submit" the browser will than send the information in that form to the hosting server (which usually has a communication capability - often an emailing system) that will let the business know that a message has been sent to them through the contact form.</p>

        <p id="question3" class="faqQuestions">Q: What do I need to consider when asking for a website to be built for me?</p>

          <p id="answer3" class="faqAnswers">A: You have to consider the complexity of what you need. Is it going to be just a one page simple website with a very simple color palett and interactivity? Or is it going to be something as complex as a social media site? The first thing to consider is... What is this website about and think about which content you want to place on that website. As the client, you need to prepare that conent for the web developer. While a developer may be willing to help you with content, it is your job to put that in writing and get it to the developer. A lot of back logs and project delays are due to the client not knowing what they want in terms of the content. The second thing to consider is... The images you will want on the website. While the developer may be able to find you some royalty-free images it is your job to find high quality images that you want to place on the website. If you think about it, what is more pleasant to the eye when you visit a website? A website with no images and just plain text? Or a website with a ton of images (in between the text) that tell a story. Humans are visual creatures and are therefore more receptive to visual stimuli. It is also your job as the client to make sure that the images you give to the developer are large and of high quality. It is easier to shrink a good quality image down to a smaller size to fit in the page than the other way around. Small images of lower quality look terrible when they need to be stretched to bigger sizes. The third thing to consider is... The color palett, the font style and any other corresponding visual information that you need to give to the developer. Telling a developer "To come up with something and then I'll see if I like it" is a surefire way to delay and drag out the development process which will cost you more in the long run. The more concise you can be with what you want as the client, the easier it will be for a developer to deliver your website to you within the agreed timeline. Guessing what a client wants is like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. In general, the best thing to do is create (what is called) a "Spec Sheet", or a document which defines all of this information for the developer along with drawings and descriptions of what you want the website to look and behave like along with any drawings you can come up with. It doesn't need to look like a super professional photoshop file, but it needs to to be clear enough to convey the ideas of what you want. Most developers are more than happy, than, to go over that spec sheet and help you fine tune the small details.</p>

        <p id="question4" class="faqQuestions">Q: How much does a website cost?</p>

          <p id="answer4" class="faqAnswers">A: The answer is largely reliant upon the complexity of the website. Some developers will work on a "per hour" basis and some will work based on a pre-agreed-upon total quote regardless of how many hours they will spend writing all of the code. There are pros and cons to both of those. It's best to speak with the developer about your project to see what will best fit both yourself (as the client) and the developer. Sometimes it's better to do a website on a per hour basis if it's a simple website. Sometimes it's better to work off of a pre-agreed-upon quote when the projects is complicated and it's hard to put a number on the hours needed to complete the website. Picking one or the other will determine the price range. In general, consider the fact that you are paying more for the expertise rather than the time spent typing code. Typing, in it of itself, is not a hard labour. But it's the "expertise" that costs the most. There is a reason why there is always high demand for developers and why they get paid good money; because not everyone can aquire the expertise needed to do this type of work. But, as a rule of thumb, expect to pay anywhere between $3K to $5K for a typical simple website with a few pages and simple interactivity. Larger projects may run $5K and above depending on the complexity.</p>

        <p id="question5" class="faqQuestions">Q: How long does it take to complete a website?</p>

          <p id="answer5" class="faqAnswers">A: This, also, largely depends on the complexity of the project. A full time developer may only need between 3-7 days to complete a one page website or months to complete a complex website that requires a ton of design elements, interactivity and mobile adaptation. Complex designs tend to take more time for mobile adaptation. If the website has a ton of unique design elements, it gets harder to make sure that those look good on a mobile sized device versus a stationary computer. There is far more space to play with on a stationary computer screen than a mobile device. What most people don't realize is that the amount of different screen sizes in today's world of technology to consider for a developer is staggering. And it's the developer's job to make sure that they adapt the website (at the very least) to the most common sizes. There is at least 10 different screen sizes a developer has to deal with and each one of those sizes requires it's own version of the styling file which may be 2,000 coding lines long or bigger. Interactivity files may get even longer when you have write a ton of custom-tailored interactivity like elements moving at different speeds, a lot of different animation that you can't accomplish with a side framework or server-side activity that requires a lot of server requests. As a rule of thumb, come into the project with an adjusted expectation allowing for delays (as they will inevitably happen) and agree upon a timeline that is a bit longer than what one would expect for a project of your size. That way you (as the client) are pleasantly surprised if the developer delivers early or at the very least not disappointed with delays when they happen. Always consider the worst case scenario timeline and go from there.</p>

        <p id="question6" class="faqQuestions">Q: Is there anything else I need to consider?</p>

          <p id="answer6" class="faqAnswers">A: There are three main things that a client needs to consider in terms of spending. The first one is... Buying a domain name. You have to have a unique domain name (or a website address) that still aptly describes your name. This is something that the client needs to purchase and have ready for the developer. The second thing to consider is... The hosting service. You cannot have a website without a domain name or a hosting service. The files that the developer will write have to be stored somewhere on a hosting service server and have to have a domain name that will point to that server. Domain names costs can range from free (if the ending extention is not widely used) to more than a $1K if the domain name is taken by someone else and it is crucial to the client. The client may need to contact the owner of that domain to see if they are willing to sell it and there is no telling how much the owner will ask for that domain name. Hosting services range from free to tens, if not hundreds, of dollars per month. While you may be able to get away with a free hosting service if your website is small in size it is generally not a good idea to go with a free hosting service if your website is a little more complex due to the amount of files that have to be uploaded to the hosting service and the fact that some free hosting services don't have the highest speeds which may mean that your website will lag when loading pages. The third thing to consider (as mentioned above) is... The "Spec Sheet". If there is no predefined spec sheet everything is going to take much longer to do. While a developer may be willing to work off of loose and vague ideas, it is not their job to try to guess what the client wants. "Coming up with something to show the client so that they will decide if they like it or not" is the least effective way to develop and is far more constly to the client. The final thing to consider is... Make sure that your budget matches the ambition of your website idea. It is not wise to expect a developer to work for cheap when your asking them to do a lot of complicated things. More than anything (as the client) you are paying for an expertise that few people have. It's a little bit like asking a doctor to perform a heart surgery. It may not be a super laborious task (in the grand scheme), but it does take a lot of expertise to do it right.</p>
